- Task 2: Calculates and displays total ticket revenue in currency format.
- Task 3: Shows attendance statistics based on ticket sales.
- Task 4: Prompts for and validates the number of participants (0-40).
- Task 5: Collects participant names and sport codes (S, B, F, V), displays sport counts, and lists participants by sport.

## How to Run
